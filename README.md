# Path-Planner
a c++ path planner class 

The goal of this project was to take path planning algorithms that I do know (Dijkstra, A*, RRT) as well as algorithms that I have not used before (Q-Learning, D*), and practice implementing them in C++ using Object Oriented Design. Another main goal was to learn how to use Qt to make a UI to go with it.
